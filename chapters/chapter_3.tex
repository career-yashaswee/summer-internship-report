\section{Chapter 3 - Project Management and Development Lifecycle}
\subsection{Introduction to Project Management}
Project management is the backbone of successful software development. It ensures that the project is delivered on time, within scope, and meets the expected quality standards. Effective project management involves coordinating resources, tasks, and timelines to achieve the project goals efficiently.

\subsection{Requirement Gathering and Analysis}
Requirement gathering is the first and most crucial phase of the project. During this phase, we engaged with stakeholders, including mentors and potential users, to understand the specific needs and expectations from the software. We documented these requirements clearly and conducted a thorough analysis to ensure that every aspect was covered and aligned with the projectâ€™s objectives.

\subsection{Planning and Task Allocation}
Planning involves breaking down the project into manageable tasks and allocating these tasks to team members based on their expertise. We used an iterative development approach, dividing the project into weekly sprints. Each team member was responsible for a specific domain, ensuring that all aspects of the project were covered comprehensively.

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{SNo.} & \textbf{Name}           & \textbf{Domain}            \\ \hline

\subsection{Iterative Development and Sprints}
We adopted an iterative development model, which allowed for continuous improvement and integration of feedback. Each week, we completed a sprint, delivering a specific set of features. This approach helped us stay on track and make necessary adjustments in response to challenges encountered during development.

\subsection{Monitoring and Reporting Progress}
To ensure transparency and accountability, we held daily scrum meetings with our mentors. During these meetings, each team member reported on their progress, challenges, and planned tasks for the day. This consistent communication helped us identify and address issues quickly, keeping the project on schedule.

\subsection{Risk Management and Mitigation}
Risk management was an integral part of our project management strategy. We identified potential risks early in the project and developed mitigation plans to address them. This proactive approach allowed us to minimize the impact of unexpected challenges and ensured the smooth progression of the project.

Exorbitant Cost for Testing Google Gemini API SDK    & Set usage limits, monitor API usage, and optimize test cases.           \\ \hline
Delays in Backend Development                        & Implement a buffer in the timeline and conduct parallel tasks.          \\ \hline
Technical Issues During Frontend Integration         & Conduct preliminary integration tests and have backup tools ready.      \\ \hline
Limited Access to AI Integration Resources           & Schedule access in advance, explore alternative resources.              \\ \hline
Data Security Breach During Database Development     & Employ encryption, secure access protocols, and regular audits.         \\ \hline
Unavailability of Team Members Due to Health Issues  & Cross-train team members and have a backup plan for critical tasks.     \\ \hline
